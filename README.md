###  GoBPM Workshop Schedule 🎄🎅🎁

#### **9:15–9:35 (20 mins): Introduction and Concept Setup** 🎁🎅🎄

##### GoBPM 
GoBPM is a emerging ligthweight opensource BPMS. Its goal is to be lightweight, accessible yet scalable and performant alternative to paid BPMS solutions.

##### Workshop

**Goal 🎯:**  
Your team will implement a simplified process which helps Santa/Ježíšek handle present processing and delivery using **GoBPM**, a simple workflow engine. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a working prototype that demonstrates key stages of a business process while applying XP principles you find suitable (Simple design, Pair Programming, Small Releases, Continuous Integration, ...).
**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Team Size:** 3-5 students

**Key Objective :** Learn to use GoBPM to model a business process and implement it step-by-step while following XP techniques to stay focused, collaborative, and iterative. 

**Tools and technologies 🛠️:** Use any tools you like. Use any programming language, use AI, use older projects. Setup yourself for Rapid progress 💪


**Achievements** 🥇🥈🥉:
- **X Points** for active teamwork and collaboration.    
- **Y Points** for the best product based on:    
    - **Functionality**: Does it work well?        
    - **Complexity**: How sophisticated is the solution?        
    - **Uniqueness**: Is it creative and different?        
    - **Fun Factor**: Does it have a fun or innovative twist?

#### **9:35–9:55 (20 mins): Requirements Gathering and User Stories** 🎄🎅🎁

- As a team, break down the process into **key steps** and turn them into **user stories** for GoBPM.
- You can use Userstory map a tool like Miro https://miro.com/app/dashboard/?tpTemplate=b41b45f2-fbe7-4236-ad92-16d845f04903&isCustom=false&share_link_id=756309004621
- Examples of user stories (**“As a \[persona\], I \[want to\], \[so that\].”**):
    1. _“As Santa, I can load a child’s wish list so I know what presents to prepare.”_
    2. _“As an elf, I can mark a present as packaged and ready.”_
    3. _“As Santa, I can view all presents ready for delivery.”_
- Choose only achievable number of small stories to implement during the workshop. 🎅🎁🎄

---

#### **9:55–10:10 (15 mins): Planning and Design** 🎁🎅🎄

- Plan your workflow model in **GoBPM**:
    - Identify the workflow steps (e.g., input wish list, package presents, mark as ready).
    - Sketch a simple process diagram.
- Focus on simplicity: Keep your implementation minimal and incremental.
- Decide on the first user story to implement and define the workflow logic for it. 🎅🎁🎄

---

#### **10:10–11:00 (50 mins): Implementation Round 1** 🎄🎅🎁

1. Work towards implementing a **working process workflow**:
    - Use GoBPM to design and implement each step of the process incrementally.
    - Test regularly to ensure each part works as expected.
2. Work **in parallel** where possible:
    - Teams can divide tasks, such as designing, coding, and testing different parts of the workflow simultaneously.
3. Rotate roles and **use all team members** effectively:
    - Alternate roles like designer, coder, and tester to involve everyone and leverage different perspectives.
4. Regularly validate progress:
    - Test and review each step to ensure it integrates well into the overall process.

**Goal for Round 1:** Make significant progress on a working process workflow, validated through regular testing and teamwork. 🎅🎁🎄

---

#### **11:00–11:10 (10 mins): Break and Check-In** 🎁🎅🎄

- Take a short break.
- Share progress and challenges as a team.
- Plan your next user story. 🎅🎁🎄

---

#### **11:10–12:00 (50 mins): Implementation Round 2** 🎄🎅🎁

- Implement the next user story using the GoBPM engine.
- Work toward creating a **presentable user interface (UI)** for your application.
- Test the workflow logic regularly to ensure it aligns with the user stories and UI functionality.
- Continue working in parallel, rotating roles and involving all team members to focus on both backend logic and UI presentation.

**Goal for Round 2:** A functional and visually presentable UI that demonstrates the core workflow of the application. 🎅🎁🎄

---

#### **12:00–12:20 (20 mins): Presentations 🎁🎅🎄

- Demonstrate your workflow model in GoBPM:
    - Show how it handles the full process (e.g., loading wish lists, preparing presents, marking delivery readiness).
- Discuss what worked well and any challenges faced. 🎅🎁🎄

---

### Reflection and Wrap-Up 🎁🎅🎄

- Reflect on using GoBPM and the XP practices:
    - How did breaking the workflow into **user stories** help?
    - Did **TDD** improve your implementation process?
    - How did **pair programming** contribute to teamwork and progress?
- Summarize takeaways:
    - GoBPM simplifies complex workflows into manageable steps.
    - XP principles help you build iteratively and collaboratively. 🎅🎁🎄

---

###  Tips for Success 🎄🎅🎁

- **Focus on GoBPM**: Keep the workflow model simple and incremental.
- **Work iteratively**: Do small increments
- **Communicate Actively**: Collaboration is key.
- **Celebrate Progress**: Partial completion of a workflow is still success! 🎅🎁🎄

---

### Expected Outcome 🎁🎅🎄

By the end of the workshop, you will:

- Have implemented a business process using GoBPM.
- Understand how XP practices support iterative development.
- Demonstrate a working prototype of the workflow model. 🎅🎁🎄

Good luck, and enjoy helping Santa deliver presents! 🎁🎅🎄
